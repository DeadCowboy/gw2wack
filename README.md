Guild Wars 2: World Auxillary Command Konsole
=============================================
The [Guild Wars 2: World Auxillary Command Konsole](http://gw2wack.mercilessgames.com/) was a pet project to create a responsive web app that reports the World vs World (WvW) match status in the computer video game [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/).  It makes use of the public Guild Wars 2 API v1 that provides real-time data on the game's current state.

The focus of creating this app was to advance my knowledge in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
